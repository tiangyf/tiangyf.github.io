            Fantastic Mr. Fox is on the run! The three
meanest farmers around are out to get him. Fat Boggis, squat
Bunce, and skinny
            Bean have joined forces, and they have Mr. Fox
and his family surrounded. What they don't know is that
they're not dealing
            with just any fox–Mr. Fox would never surrender.
But only the most fantastic plan ever can save him now.

         When Willy Wonka decides to let five children into his 
         chocolate factory, he decides to release five golden 
         tickets in five separate chocolate bars, 
         causing complete mayhem. The tickets start to be found, 
         with the fifth going to a very special boy, called 
         Charlie Bucket. With his Grandpa, Charlie joins the 
         rest of the children to experience the most amazing 
         factory ever. But not everything goes to plan within
          the factory.
